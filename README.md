A portfolio of Jupyter files related to topics that we have addressed in class.  The easiest way to work with these files is to download the entire section in a .zip file.  

If you do not have software to run the Jupyter files, I suggest Anaconda.  You can download it <a href='https://www.continuum.io/downloads'>here</a>. Once you have downloaded the files you can open the Navigator.  From there simply lauch Jupyter notebook.  

The files are written in Python so the language should be familiar if you want to edit them.
