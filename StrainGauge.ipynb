    "In this notebook, we're going to use Python/NumPy/Matplotlib to perform strain gauge calcuations. The Strain Gauge notebook uses the strain transformation equations from the stress and strain transformation notebook to perform strain gauge calculations. There are two other related notbooks that you should  visit related to stress and strain transformations **Stress and Strain Transformations** and **Mohr's Circle**. The Stress and Strain Transformation notebook will calculate the stresses and/or strain after a rotation about the $z$-axis. The Mohr's circle notebook will calculate the principals stresses (or strains) and plot Mohr's circle.  "
